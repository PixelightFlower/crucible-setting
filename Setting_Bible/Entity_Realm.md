# Entities and Their Realms
![A diagram of the Wheel, 8 worlds arranged in a circle. Clockwise: a world made of white cubes, a world made of teeth and meat, a sunrise world made of orange amber, an industrial world of yellow smog, a black world made of shadows and stars, a green world that looks like a giant tree, a blue world made of two oceans one made of daydreams the other made of nightmares, a purple world that is a maze made of fungi.](/Setting_Bible/images/Wheel_Map.png "Wheel Map by pixelightflower")

<h2>Entities</h2>

  <li>Locks</li>
  <li>Secrets</li>
  <li>Foundations</li>
</ul>
<p>The Colour White and The Cathedral of Bone are associated with selfishness, things that you hold close to yourself that no one is meant to know. These things give you structure and foundation, like the bones in the body. It also represents what seperates you from other people, such as a cage might. The Cathedral of Bone holds secrets close, and anything it deems necessary. Order streams out of it like a dusty wind. It is commonly assumed that it exists within the mega cathedral of Ecclesia, if not being the cathedral itself.</p>
</p>

<h3>The Thousand Teeth</h3>
<p>Associated Colour: Red <br>
Associated Symbol: Dripping Blood <br>
Associated Element: Blood <br>
Themes:
<ul>
  <li>Appetite, Hunger, Gluttony</li>
  <li>The parts of a person that are meat</li>
</ul>
<p>The Colour Red and The Thousand Teeth are associated with passion and need. It wants to consume, to absorb, to make as much of the world a part of itself as possible. It is the iidea that you are what you eat, sometimes in a truly literal sense. It is assumed that the realm of Swelter is the body of The Thousand Teeth, and its vast chambers and mouths are its welcoming hunger.</p>
</p>

  <li>Light, the flow of energy</li>
  <li>Mania, burning out</li>
</ul>
<p>The Colour Orange and The Liquid Sun are associated with charisma and insipiration, the heights of creative endeavour to the point of mania. The Liquid Sun is often assumed to exist in the floating globules of amber light that fill the skies of Aura.</p>
</p>

<h3>The Precipice Contagion</h3>

Associated Element: Choler (Bile) <br>

  <li>Fever Dreams, illness</li>
  <li>Innovation that comes from desperation at the knife's edge</li>
  <li>Pushing limitations, breaking boundaries, going to the extreme</li>
</ul>
<p>The Colour Yellow and The Precipice Contagion are associated with Obsession and Burn Out. There is some debate if The Precipice Contagion is a literal plague that spreads through the ever present smog of Rot, driving people with insomnia to ever increasing need to work, produce, create, and then burn out like a firework.</p>
</p>

<h3>The Twisting Verdancy</h3>
<p>Associated Colour: Green <br>
Associated Symbol: A sprout with two spiral leaves <br>
Associated Element: Vitrum (Uranium Glass) <br>

<ul>
  <li>Growth as a natural part of aging</li>
  <li>The Cycle of life and death</li>
  <li>Reproduction, creation</li>
</ul>
<p>The Colour Green and The Twisting Verdancy are associated with Reproduction and Legacy. Most often, this takes the form of literal offspring or creative works, the need to make more and for those creations to outlast you. The Twisting Verdancy is sometimes cited as existing in an odd, spiralling cavern deep in the center of Velde from which a perpetual green light shines. The light twists what it shines on, making things grow more and more, like an unending, undieing cancer.</p>
</p>

<h3>The Endless Dream</h3>
<p>Associated Colour: Blue <br>
Associated Symbol: Mirrors <br>
Associated Element: Gallium <br>
Themes:
<ul>
  <li>Dualities</li>
  <li>Daydreams/Nightmares</li>
  <li>Sleeping/Waking</li>
  <li>Loneliness/Connection</li>
</ul>
<p>The Colour Blue and The Endless Dream are associated with Dualities and Connection. It's often the colour of affection and compassion, and The Endless Dream is an entity used as a symbol of love. The Endless Dream is a conjoined, fused entity formed from The Endless Dream and The Twilight Hour. They and their realms merged to form Ebb and The Endless Dream. The Endless Dream is generally represented with mirrors and reflected surfaces. Some scholars theorize that The Endless Dream is the quicksilver moon that orbits Ebb and can occasionally be seen from other spokes.
</p>

<h3>The Flower Fields</h3>
<p>Associated Colour: Violet <br>
Associated Symbol: A wrapped candy sweet with a spiral in the center <br>
Associated Element: Sugar <br>
Themes:
<ul>
  <li>Nostalgia, comfort for its own sake</li>
  <li>Paralysis, restless torpor</li>
  <li>Perceptual disturbance and manipulation</li>
</ul>
<p>The Colour Violet and The Flower Fields are associated with Memory and Comfort. This often includes nostalgia as well as trauma, those parts of one's mind that form a person day by day. The Flower Fields is assumed to be the massive fungal hivemind that fills Maze. The Flower Fields seeks to bring comfort to all that come Maze, a comfort that draws people into an endless hallucinatory torpor.</p>
</p>

<h3>The Iron Gate</h3>
<p>Associated Colour: Black <br>
Associated Symbol: An Iron Key <br>
Associated Element: Carbon <br>
Themes:
<ul>
  <li>Eyes open</li>
  <li>Secrets sought and revealed</li>
  <li>Questioning the status quo</li>
  <li>Opened/opening locks</li>
</ul>
<p>The Colour Black and The Iron Gate are associated with Curiousity and Seeking. They are the drive to know, the need to find new things and new experiences. The Iron Gate is the open door, it is the invitation to step inside. Ironically, The Black Iron Gate is the only entity to have no known physical location on The Wheel. Despite its encouragement to learn, to seek, to uncover secrets and truths no one has yet determined if The Iron Gate even exists at all.
</p>

<h2>Realms</h2>
<p>The Realms of the Wheel, also called Spokes, are differentiated worlds that have grown around the various Entities. They are filled with living people of various shapes, plants and fauna, and odd localized physics. Each Realm is defined and seperate, and the ways one can travel from one to the next are often esoteric. It is as possible to walk from Rot to Sable as it is to sail on a ship from Velde through Ebb and into the Maze. Travel between the Spokes often has more to do with what it FEELS like should happen rather than what should logically occur.</p>
<h3>Ossiary</h3>
<p>"In Secrets Defined"
<ul>
  <li>A place known for symmetry, absolute law and absolute silence. All secrets are kept and never spoken. A place of byzantine laws and order kept at the pace of the clock's tick. Peoples that live in Ossiary tend to live a life of monastic service and simplicity. At their worse, they are known for being extremely selfish and insular, to the point of abject cruelty.</li>
  <li>Ossiary is formed of a multitude of bone white cubes floating together in the ether. Each cube has localized gravity that adheres to each of its six sides. The image of Ossiary is dominated by a massive mega-cathedral on the largest cube, Ecclesia.</li>
  <li>Ossiary has no trade, people perform their functiions and are sustained.</li>
  <li>Native Inhabitants: Crowns, Bone Wasps</li>
  <li>Capital City: Ecclesia</li>
</ul>

<h3>Swelter</h3>
<p>"We are no more than Meat and no less than Flesh"
<ul>
  <li>A place of flesh and hunger, dominated by gluttony and lusts.</li>
  <li>Swelter is often assumed to literally be the body of the Entity The Thousand Teeth, within which its inhabitants have carved homes in its bones and made a meal of its flesh. This is assumed to be the way Chimera were first formed. Houses are often made of bone, objects made of various leathers, ivories and keratin.</li>
  <li>Swelter trades in Beads, made of pressed flower petals and probably blood, they’re generally inconsistently formed. Larger amounts come in different shapes.</li>
  <li>Native Inhabitants: Chimera</li>
  <li>Capital City: Dis
    <ul>
	    <li>Caro</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Aura</h3>
<p>"Live in Every Mote of Sunlight"
<ul>
  <li>Aura is lit by a sky full of suns and glowing motes of amber light. There is no true night in Aura, the closest is a burnt orange sky and the colour of amber light. Aura is a circular mobius strip, a double sided loop around a massive wobbling mass of amber light.</li>
  <li>A place of golden and picturesque dawns, vast brass trees that grow crystalline fruit. Globules of liquid light fill the sky called amber lights, the most well known feature of Aura. Life in Aura is often considered exhausting and busy by those not used to its intense pace.</li>
  <li>Aura trades in thin golden coins called Motes</li>
  <li>Native Inhabitants: Sol Bats, Guild Bees</li>
  <li>Capital City: Halcyon
    <ul>
	    <li>Pyrite</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Rot</h3>
<p>"May Death Drive us to Live"
<ul>
  <li>A place abuzz with frantic desperate action, often considered a pariah realm that few outside of Rat Rats willingly enter. Filled with flowers, the scent of semi rotting vegetation and oily smog is pervasive. The cities of Rot are massive sprawling things filled with factory complexes.</li>
  <li>Rot is filled with various urban acclimated climbing flowers, many with wiry stalks and serrated leaves. Their flowers are heady and chloratic, straining to reach out past the ever present smog.</li>
  <li>Rot trades in Hours, oily silver hexagons with hourglasses on them</li>
  <li>Native Inhabitants: Rot Rats</li>
  <li>Capital City: Moulder
    <ul>
	    <li>Kindle</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Velde</h3>
<p>"Grow. Spread. Thrive."
<ul>
  <li>An immense arboreal realm filled with twisting trunks and vines and obscenely fruiting canopies, Beautiful, if sinister in that it never stops moving, stops seeking, stops wanting more. Velde is beautiful from a distance, though people not native to the realm are put off by the deep seated societal pressure to create by any means.</li>
  <li>Velde doesn't have a specific coinage, relying entirely on barter for created objects</li>
  <li>Native Inhabitants: Flower Dragons</li>
  <li>Capital City: Veradas
    <ul>
	    <li>Blossom Forth</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Ebb</h3>
<p>"Fly in Silent Dreaming."
<p>Two spokes of the wheel that were forced together by the Endless Twilight when the two entities Endless Dreamer (Cyan) and Twilight Hour (Indigo) fused themselves together. They were known as the conjoined ones, the entity most associated with homosexual lovers as they are generally depicted as two femme, two masc or two gender undefined bodies conjoined together. The Daylight Ocean is a place of archipelagos, floating islands of pleasant day dreams and strange imagery. The Daylight Ocean obfuscates itself with unreliable winds and odd currents. The Silent Sea is a windless sea of dark water, the surface only moves when the creatures beneath slither through its oily waters. The Silent Sea goes from Velde to Sable if you know how to navigate it, but the nightmares stalk its dismal foggy shores.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Daylight Ocean trades in illusions and dreams as payment for services while the Silent Sea trades in fear and nightmares. They take the shape of silver hoops of various sizes, usually worn as jewelry.</li>
  <li>Native Inhabitants: Dreaming Harts, Sea Horses</li>
  <li>Capital Cities: 
    <ul>
	    <li>The Silent Sea, Dread</li>
	    <li>The Pearl Ocean, Muse</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Maze</h3>
<p>"Rest Your Mind and Your Heart will soon Follow"
<ul>
  <li>An endless maze of caverns, lit in soft tones, scented of nostalgia. A place meant to ensnare the unwary with longed for memories and loving embrace. Easiest to get stuck here while exploring the Daylight Ocean, or as succour for a traveller in the Silent Sea. Filled with luminescent mushrooms, oozing lichen, fields of sporing mushrooms with cloying pollen.</li>
  <li>Maze is filled with a vast network of fungus that forms a symbiotic hivemind with its inhabitants. The True capital of Maze exists as a shared hallucination of its denizens, a psychedelic place of metaphor and meaning and distraction. All are equal in the true capital of Maze.</li>
  <li>Maze has no noteworthy trade outside of occasional barter</li>
  <li>Native Inhabitants: Bloom Olm, Dust Moths</li>
  <li>Capital City: Reverie
    <ul>
	    <li>Hyphaea</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sable</h3>
<p>"The Door is Always Open"
<ul>
  <li>Known for secrets waiting to be revealed, filled with makers and those that seek hidden truths. The most noteworthy landmark is the Astra Valley, a star shaped river valley that butts up to several geological features. It is also the main populated portion of the Spoke as the Moon that lights up from the distant ceiling gives it a few hours of light a day. Sable is a realm housed inside a darkened cavern, utterly pitch black save the lights of crystal stars in the cavern ceiling far overhead. The Moon of Ebb is visible from Sable for a short period of the day owing to a massive clear crystal window in the ceiling above.</li>
  <li>Sable trades in Lux, a paper money with luminescent ink</li>
  <li>Native Inhabitants: Grave Dogs</li>
  <li>Capital City: Midnight 
    <p>Midnight is beyond the Umbral Mountain where no light of the moon can reach, because of that they’ve filled their dark city with artificial light. It looks like a star field from above, and it bustles with life.</p>
    <ul>
	    <li>Lumineux</li>
	    <li>Moonwell</li>
	    <li>Little Umbra</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>
