<h2>Species</h2>
<h3>Carnal Chimera</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Chimera can appear as any arrangement of animal like parts as long has at least one mouth.</li>
  <li>Native to Swelter</li>
  <li>Maw of Many
    <ul>
	  <li>Chimera can eat any biological material and incorporate it into their being, this is often used for fashionable body horror. There is no upper limit on this ability, the more things they eat the larger they become. Over time, material is "digested" and those aspects will fade. Chimera are also capable of regurgitating parts of their body if they no longer desire them.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Crown</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Crowns can appear as any animal or species but are generally bigger than usual and possess more fanciful features. The notable feature of Crowns is a symbol shape that floats above or behind their head at all times. This image is always in the same place relative to the viewer, regardless of how the Crown is viewed. These symbolic images vary widely between different Crowns and represent the Crown's purpose.</li>
  <li>The first Crowns are recorded as having come from Ossiary fully formed, though they can be born to any parent.</li>
  <li>Angelic Mien
    <ul>
	  <li>Crowns are always imposing, some causing outright awe in those that view them. Their words are commanding and difficult to ignore.</li>
	  <li>Each Crown has a purpose, some fundamental concept, which they can speak as absolute truth to command reality. This can be as simple as, "Tomorrow Will Always Come", thrusting the subject forward a day in time. If a Crown betrays their purpose somehow, their symbol will shatter.</li>
	  <li>Shattered Crowns have the inverse of their usual powers, and others find them offputting, confusing and mentally exhausting. They are unable to speak their truth in reality.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Grave Dog</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Grave Dogs appear as bipedal canine people, the sort of canine they resemble can be nearly any sort. They are well known for their skull and bone fur/skin markings which are often luminous under blacklight. Some varieties have flowers that grow through their fur, appearing like funerary wreaths or bundles of grave flowers.</li>
  <li>Native to Sable</li>
  <li>Dead Bones Speak
    <ul>
	  <li>Grave Dogs can hear the whispers and speech of the recently dead. The longer a body decays, the quieter they appear to a listening Grave Dog. Some particular individuals train this ability to the point of even being able to see the dead as well. Grave Dogs are particularly good at detecting Wandering Spirits and can tell them apart from the lingering memory of the truly dead.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Dreaming Hart</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dreaming Harts are deer shaped and bipedal, often tall. Their fur patterns have heart and sleep motifs. Most notably, Dreaming Harts have three eyes, a third eye that sits upon their brow. Dreaming Harts are known for having an odd manner about them, due to the ability of their third eye.</li>
  <li>Native to Ebb, on the daylight side</li>
  <li>Prisma Eye
    <ul>
	  <li>Dreaming Harts have a third eye that sees prisma auras. If trained, they can also see into dreams and catch snippets of daydreams and flights of fancy. Some can see into Dream Side, which is known to be a poor idea while awake.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
  
<h3>Sea Horse</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sea Horses are horse shaped bipeds with sea dragon motifs, irridescent scales, fins and horns. Sea Horses tend to have an asymmetrical amount of eyes of different colours and shapes. Though uncommon, some have an angler-like illicium that glows in dim light. Sea Horses have hooved feet and hands with webs between the digits.</li>
  <li>Native to Ebb, on the night side</li>
  <li>Protean Flesh
    <ul>
	  <li>Sea Horses can change their appearance, for most it's limited to small subtle things like fur colour, markings and some adjustment of facial features. Those that train this ability can change their entire body, as long as they retain the same amount of mass, they can appear as a whole other species.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Sol Bat</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sol Bats are large, bat like bipeds with winged forearms. Large relative to terrestial bats, they generally don't break past a meter in height when standing. Most Sol Bats are furred to some extent, with large ears and developed noses. Their coloration and markings have sun and sky motifs and tend toward gold and sunrise colours. Sol Bat eyes and blood is notably amber coloured.</li>
  <li>Native to Aura</li>
  <li>Inspirational Corona
    <ul>
	  <li>Sol Bats literally glow with the light of inspiration and charisma. They can use this to shake the souls of those around them, influencing one or more of their soul pigments.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Rot Rat</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Rot Rats are bipedal rodent like people, generally shorter than a meter in height. Their appearance can include rat, opossum, vole or mouse like. They markings have motifs of death, decay and/or flowers. Their appearance is often strongly affected by their unique sickness.</li>
  <li>Native to Rot</li>
  <li>Soul Borne Sickness
    <ul>
	  <li>Rot Rats carry a soul borne sickness that resembles a magical curse. This curse causes them to suffer a malady associated with one of their soul pigments. This can cause that pigment to be absent in their life, overactive or otherwise act in a way abnormal. It is possible for this sickness to be passed to others if a Rot Rat were to learn the skill, this is what causes people to view Rot Rats and the realm of Rot to be pariah.</li>
	  <li>Example, a Red Soul Borne Sickness would cause the Rat to be unable to feel sated or joy from physical pleasures, or it might make them unable to feel intense emotions regardless of the situation, it might also mean they have no meat to their body at all, it could also mean they have vampire like tendencies and need to feed on the blood of others to sustain themselves</li>
	  <li>Nearly all of these Soul Born Sicknesses cause Rot Rats to be very long lived, often keeping them alive for centuries.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Flower Dragon</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Flower Dragons are quadrapedal dragon like people, most individuals easily 2 meters tall at the shoulders. They have flower motifs in their manes, scales and body shapes as well as literal flowers as part of their bodies in many cases. Flower Dragons have opposable thumbs on all of their limbs and some have more than four limbs overall. Additionally, it is possible for them to stand on their hindlegs but this is unsustainable for long lengths of time.</li>
  <li>Native to Velde</li>
  <li>Flower Arcana
    <ul>
	  <li>Depending on the species of flower they resemble, which generally follows genetic lineages and local flora, they have various magical abilities that follow from what their flowers symbolize or what the plants are capable of chemically.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Bloom Olm</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bloom Olm are long, olm shaped, and dragonic in body type. Technically quadrapedal, they often move like land serpents. Olms are often blind or have very poor eyesight, some have a third eye that can see people's paths of intention but little else. It's often more confusing than not.</li>
  <li>Native to Maze</li>
  <li>Psionics
    <ul>
	  <li>Bloom Olm are specially connected with the fungal hivemind of Maze and constantly emit psionic spores around them. These spores create temporary psychic connections with those around them, with longer durations possible with extended contact. This effect is only noticeable when the Olm is "in bloom". Through these connections, Olm can read surface thoughts of people around them.</li>
	</ul></li>
