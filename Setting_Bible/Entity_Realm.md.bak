# Entities and Their Realms
![A diagram of the Wheel, 8 worlds arranged in a circle. Clockwise: a world made of white cubes, a world made of teeth and meat, a sunrise world made of orange amber, an industrial world of yellow smog, a black world made of shadows and stars, a green world that looks like a giant tree, a blue world made of two oceans one made of daydreams the other made of nightmares, a purple world that is a maze made of fungi.](/Setting_Bible/images/Wheel_Map.png "Wheel Map by pixelightflower")

<h3>Rot</h3>
<p>"May Death Drive us to Live"
<ul>
  <li>A place abuzz with frantic desperate action, often considered a pariah realm that few outside of Rat Rats willingly enter. Hallucinogenics and drug use run rampant through Rot, and some of the best psychotropics come from its labs. Filled with flowers, the scent of semi rotting vegetation is pervasive.</li>
  <li>Rot is filled with various urban acclimated climbing flowers, many with wiry stalks and serrated leaves. Their flowers are heady and chloratic, straining to reach out past the ever present smog.</li>
  <li>Rot trades in Hours, oily silver hexagons with hourglasses on them</li>
  <li>Native Inhabitants: Rot Rats</li>
  <li>Capital City: Moulder
    <ul>

<h3>Velde</h3>

  <li>An immense arboreal realm filled with twisting trunks and vines and obscenely fruiting canopies, Beautiful, if sinister in that it never stops moving, stops seeking, stops wanting more.</li>

  <li>Capital City: Veradas
    <ul>
	    <li>Blossom Forth</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Ebb</h3>
<p>"Fly in Silent Dreaming."
<p>Two spokes of the wheel that were forced together by the Endless Twilight when the two entities Endless Dreamer (Cyan) and Twilight Hour (Indigo) fused themselves together. They were known as the conjoined ones, the entity most associated with homosexual lovers as they are generally depicted as two femme, two masc or two gender undefined bodies conjoined together. The Daylight Ocean is a place of archipelagos, floating islands of pleasant day dreams and strange imagery. The Daylight Ocean obfuscates itself with unreliable winds and odd currents. The Silent Sea is a windless sea of dark water, the surface only moves when the creatures beneath slither through its oily waters. The Silent Sea goes from Velde to Sable if you know how to navigate it, but the nightmares stalk its dismal foggy shores.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Daylight Ocean trades in illusions and dreams as payment for services while the Silent Sea trades in fear and nightmares. They take the shape of silver hoops of various sizes, usually worn as jewelry.</li>
  <li>Native Inhabitants: Dreaming Harts, Sea Horses</li>
  <li>Capital Cities: 
    <ul>
	    <li>The Silent Sea, Dread</li>
	    <li>The Pearl Ocean, Muse</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Maze</h3>
<p>"Rest Your Mind and Your Heart will soon Follow"
<ul>
  <li>An endless maze of caverns, lit in soft tones, scented of nostalgia. A place meant to ensnare the unwary with longed for memories and loving embrace. Easiest to get stuck here while exploring the Daylight Ocean, or as succour for a traveller in the Silent Sea. Filled with luminescent mushrooms, oozing lichen, fields of sporing mushrooms with cloying pollen.</li>
  <li>Maze is filled with a vast network of fungus that forms a symbiotic hivemind with its inhabitants. The True capital of Maze exists as a shared hallucination of its denizens, a psychedelic place of metaphor and meaning and distraction.</li>
  <li>Maze has no noteworthy trade outside of occasional barter</li>
  <li>Native Inhabitants: Bloom Olm, Dust Moths</li>
  <li>Capital City: Reverie
    <ul>
	    <li>Hyphaea</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sable</h3>
<p>"The Door is Always Open"
<ul>
  <li>Known for secrets waiting to be revealed, filled with makers and those that seek hidden truths. The most noteworthy landmark is the Astra Valley, a star shaped river valley that butts up to several geological features. It is also the main populated portion of the Spoke as the Moon that lights up from the distant ceiling gives it a few hours of light a day.</li>
  <li>Sable trades in Lux, a paper money with luminescent ink</li>
  <li>Native Inhabitants: Grave Dogs</li>
  <li>Capital City: Midnight 
    <p>Midnight is beyond the Umbral Mountain where no light of the moon can reach, because of that they’ve filled their dark city with artificial light. It looks like a star field from above, and it bustles with life.</p>
    <ul>
	    <li>Lumineux</li>
	    <li>Moonwell</li>
	    <li>Little Umbra</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>
