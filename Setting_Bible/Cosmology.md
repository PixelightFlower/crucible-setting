# Cosmology
<p>The shape of the Crucible (alternatively called the Wheel) Cosmos. The nature of the universe, a summary of its elements and the nature of being.</p>

<h2>Shape of the Universe</h2>

Clockwise: white with a stylized cage, red with a stylized drop of blood, orange in the shape of the sun, yellow in the shape of the alchemical symbol for arsenic stylized like an hourglass, black in the shape of a key, green in the shape of a plant sprout with two spiral leaves, blue in the shape of a stylized mirror and purple in the shape of a wrapped candy with a spiral in its center.](/Setting_Bible/images/Wheel_Diagram.png "Diagram of the Crucible Cosmos by pixelightflower")

<h3>The Wheel</h3>
<p>The Wheel Cosmos is a universe built on the Rule of Threes, the Inevitable Revolution and the idea of Duality. Most things come in sets or multiples of three, or in opposing pairs. The shape of things tends toward circles, an Inevitable Revolution. Because of this, there exists a circular series of worlds called Spokes named for how they radiate around the Wheel. These spokes are what is spoken of when the Wheel is discussed. They exist in a specific sequence placed opposite their oppositional world. Each Spoke is the realm of an Entity. These Entities are the living embodiment of some essential notion of life as we'd understand it. They are also each associated with a colour of visible light as well as white and black. (Do other Entities associated with colours outside of the human perception exist? Yes, but they represent qualities that are not relevant to a human like experience.)</p>
<h3>The Crucible</h3>
<p>In the center of the Wheel is The Crucible. The Crucible is the distillation of each of the Spokes of the Wheel into a highly ordered, physical realm that resembles the universe of the reader. Generally, Crucible is assumed to be the spherical world on which humans reside whereas The Crucible refers to the universe at the center of The Wheel. Crucible is seperated from the Wheel by fundamental natural forces of the cosmos and the span between them can only be traversed in particular, often esoteric ways. From the perspective of Crucible, The Wheel would be a fantasy story, as their night sky is full of stars and inky black void. To denizens of The Wheel, Crucible is a mysterious place from which witches come, and humans call upon the most strange terrible of their inhabitants to grant boons.</p>
<h3>Interstitial Spaces</h3>
<p>What about the space between The Wheel and The Crucible? This is called the Metaphysical Plane or more often Grey Side. It is a realm of fog, grey mists, silhoettes and shadows of the physical world. It is filled with symbolic representations of all things that possess Potentia, or, the capacity to exert agency in the realm of the physical.</p>
<p>And the space outside of the wheel? This is called the Plane of Possibility or more commonly Dream Side. A surreal realm of colour and chaos, wild creative energy that splashes across the firmaments of reality until all sense and reason breaks down.</p>

<h2>Elements</h2>

Clockwise: white bone dust, red blood, orange amber, yellow bile, black iron, green glass, liquid blue metal, purple tinted sugar. In the center are three more elements, salt in the shape of a perfect white cube, ovum in the shape of a black egg with an infinity symbol in its center, slime in the shape of an oozing colour wheel.](/Setting_Bible/images/Elemental_Diagram.png "Diagram of the Alchemical Elements of the Crucible Cosmos by pixelightflower")

<p>The elements of the Wheel are differentiated by the elements representing the 8 entities and the three elements that make up all living beings of the Wheel.</p>

<h2>Being</h2>
<p>People are tripartite constructs consisting of Potentia, Soul Pigment and Physicality. It can be thought of as Potential, Creativity and Physical Existence. For our purposes, a person is a willful existence that is capable of change with a physical shape. There are other things that can exist in the world lacking one or more of these parts but for our purposes they are not people in the strictest sense. People stop being people when they lose any of the three parts of Being. They occupy a nebulous space of not-quite-being until they fill in the gaps or dissolve into the ether.</p>
<p>“Perception” versus “effect” is important to bring up here. For our purposes to perceive a dimension is to be able to perceive its existence and shape. Being able to effect change in that dimension is different entirely. For instance, we can perceive time but not manipulate it. We can perceive and manipulate physical dimensions within constraints. We can perceive and manipulate the Plane of Dreams only while dreaming. Prophets can perceive the Meta-Phys Plane, often disconnected from their perception of linear time, but they cannot affect it in any way.</p>

<h3>Meta-Potentia</h3>
<p>A person’s meta-potentia is their capacity to affect the world around them. It is a connection to the meta-phys plane which is a place that is roughly a 1:1 simulacra of the physical world. The difference is in meaning and symbolism which is represented literally there. Anything that affects the physical world has an meta-potentia, a representation in the meta-phys plane or more accurately their presence in the meta-plane is evidence of their ability to affect the physical world. Without an meta-potentia of some sort a being cannot affect the world. This connection is also a force of order, an interpretation of the world as an orderly place where things happen in sequence. Potentia are metaphorically linked to their physical bodies with a silver cord, if this is cut the physical body loses that connection. The consciousness of the being is not lost, but discontinuity with the body happens immediately. They are awake in the meta-phys plane and usually drawn to The Wheel regardless of where they came from, they essentially become a Wandering Spirit. A being with a living physical body and soul pigment but no potentia is essentially comatose, a passive player in a perpetual dream. A being with soul pigment and potentia but no physical body is a wandering spirit.</p>
<p>Wandering spirits can still affect the physical world but have no physical body. Being that the physical body is what grounds a being in the here and now, lending shape to them and continuity to their actions, a wandering spirit has to work very hard to remain themself without losing track of their own being. The greatest danger is loss of self. Wandering spirits often keep mementos and objects of affection so that they can keep track of themselves and their past. Memories are associated with physical objects and beings, without a physical body memories are more difficult to keep a hold of and need physical receptacles to keep straight. Wandering Spirits are able to possess objects with no potentia of their own, and in this way avoid complete dissolution.</p>
