# Cosmology
<p>The shape of the Crucible (alternatively called the Wheel) Cosmos. The nature of the universe, a summary of its elements and the nature of being.</p>

<h2>Shape of the Universe</h2>

![A diagram of the Crucible Cosmos. In the center is a rust coloured basin with 8 spouts called the Crucible. Surrounding the Crucible is a circle of 8 colours. Clockwise: white with a stylized cage, red with a stylized drop of blood, orange in the shape of the sun, yellow in the shape of the alchemical symbol for arsenic stylized like an hourglass, black in the shape of a key, green in the shape of a plant sprout with two spiral leaves, blue in the shape of a stylized mirror and purple in the shape of a wrapped candy with a spiral in its center.](/Setting_Bible/images/Wheel_Diagram.png "Diagram of the Crucible Cosmos by pixelightflower")

<h3>The Wheel</h3>
<p>The Wheel Cosmos is a made universe built on the Rule of Threes, the Inevitable Revolution and the idea of Duality. Most things come in sets or multiples of three, or in opposing pairs. The shape of things tends toward circles, an Inevitable Revolution. Because of this, there exists a circular series of worlds called Spokes named for how they radiate around the Wheel. These spokes are what is spoken of when the Wheel is discussed. They exist in a specific sequence placed opposite their oppositional world. Each Spoke is the realm of an Entity. These Entities are the living embodiment of some essential notion of life as we'd understand it. They are also each associated with a colour of visible light as well as white and black. (Do other Entities associated with colours outside of the human perception exist? Yes, but they represent qualities that are not relevant to a human like experience.)</p>
<h3>The Crucible</h3>
<p>In the center of the Wheel is The Crucible. The Crucible is the distillation of each of the Spokes of the Wheel into a highly ordered, physical realm that resembles the universe of the reader. Generally, Crucible is assumed to be the spherical world on which humans reside whereas The Crucible refers to the universe at the center of The Wheel. Crucible is seperated from the Wheel by fundamental natural forces of the cosmos and the span between them can only be traversed in particular, often esoteric ways. From the perspective of Crucible, The Wheel would be a fantasy story, as their night sky is full of stars and inky black void. To denizens of The Wheel, Crucible is a mysterious place from which witches come, and humans call upon the most strange terrible of their inhabitants to grant boons.</p>
<h3>Interstitial Spaces</h3>
<p>What about the space between The Wheel and The Crucible? This is called the Metaphysical Plane or more often Grey Side. It is a realm of fog, grey mists, silhoettes and shadows of the physical world. It is filled with symbolic representations of all things that possess Potentia, or, the capacity to exert agency in the realm of the physical.</p>
<p>And the space outside of the wheel? This is called the Plane of Possibility or more commonly Dream Side. A surreal realm of colour and chaos, wild creative energy that splashes across the firmaments of reality until all sense and reason breaks down.</p>

<h2>Elements</h2>

Clockwise: white bone dust, red blood, orange amber, yellow bile, black iron, green glass, liquid blue metal, purple tinted sugar. In the center are three more elements, salt in the shape of a perfect white cube, ovum in the shape of a black egg with an infinity symbol in its center, slime in the shape of an oozing colour wheel.](/Setting_Bible/images/Elemental_Diagram.png "Diagram of the Alchemical Elements of the Crucible Cosmos by pixelightflower")
